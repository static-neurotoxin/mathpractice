# makesheet.py

This is a quick and dirty script to generate simple math practice worksheets

Currently you need to modify the script to change what sort of practice problems that are generated; this isn't really a drawback in my use case as I only change the criteria less than once a week.

Usage:

```sh
python3 ./makesheet.py | lp -
```

This generates a sheet and sends it to the default printer.
